# Introduction to Cere DDC

The DDC is a Decentralized Data Cloud protocol built from the ground up for Web3, capable of powering a future of interoperable, privacy-preserving, and serverless data.

It’s a unique combination of storage and CDN clusters that makes it easy for developers to reliably deliver content and makes dApp development a breeze.

Compared with other storage and CDN protocols, it gives more control, flexibility, and ease of integration to developers. It allows developers to choose geographical cluster locations, data replication levels, private/public data sharing, encryption and more.
