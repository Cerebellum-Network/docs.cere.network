# Introduction to Cere DDC

DDC is a decentralised data cloud protocol that makes it very easy to securely store and serve assets.

It’s unique combination of storage and cdn clusters improves the capabilities to reliably deliver content and makes dApp development a breeze.

Compared with other storage and cdn protocols it gives full control, flexibility and ease of integration to developers. It allows developers to choose geographical cluster locations, data replication levels, private/public data sharing, encryption, etc…

Follow the [developer’s guide](ddc/developer-guide) to get started with the SDKs.

Check the [Extended Developer Program](edp/) for more about the official Cere Network developer community.
