# Introduction to Cere DDC

The DDC is a Decentralized Data Cloud protocol built from the ground up for Web3, capable of powering a future of interoperable, privacy-preserving, serverless data.

Itâ€™s a unique combination of storage and CDN clusters that make it easy for developers to reliably deliver content while making dApp development a breeze.

Compared with other storage and CDN protocols, it offers more control, flexibility, and ease of integration for developers. It allows developers to choose geographical cluster locations, data replication levels, private/public data sharing, encryption, and more.
