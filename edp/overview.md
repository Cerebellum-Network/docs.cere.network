## Extended Developer Program ##

The Extended Developer Program is a Cere backed program offering early joining, tech-savvy individuals, teams and enterprises close and early access to important changes in the ecosystem. 

Through this program, the Cere Network team engages with developers on-line and IRL at events, collaborating within the community and ecosystem at large to build the future of decentralized data storage solutions as laid out in the Cere Network Vision 2.0 whitepaper (LINK MISSING). 

We work with the community to help us test our code, build client SDKs, identify bugs and security vulnerabilities, and build new tools and integrations with other blockchain projects and initiatives.

## OGs
Everyone in the community can participate. Elite contributors earn the ability to get early access to support and resources around validator node pool, community admins and MODs, github project comitters, and sometimes Cere Network colleagues! 

We call these elite leads in our community `OG`, like `old-gansgsta`.  They are responsible for helping at all levels of the community. We couldn't work without them, and they get paid for their work. You'll see them around, and know it when you do. 

In the future, OGs will also be a major source of any DAOs Cere EDP community might initiate around the EDP program. Stay tuned!

## Bounties
As Cere Network and Cere IO continue to make new releases, Cere EDP community will continue to explore these new territories together, as well.

EDP drives community engagement primarily through Bounty campaigns. These campaigns will offer many opportunities to learn, share and contribute to the Cere Network ecosystem. 

Some examples of incentivized bounties might include the posting of ðŸ§µ's and youtube video bounties or various technical bounties that help us secure Cere Network, improve or add features, and solve real-world problems.

The best will have additional opportunities to move up the leaderboard, unlocking new potential along the journey. Perks include accessing project grants and sponsorships, CERE token rewards, event participation packages, and the ultimate reward -> an invitation to becoming an OG.

More details about bounties in the [Bounties](bounties.md) section.
