# Bounties

Our bounty program is to invite the community to take part in the development of the Cere Network ecosystem. It covers core projects and tooling from validator nodes to SDKs and integrations. Both technical and non-technical bounties will be issued. 

## Introduction

Bounties will come in various types and sizes. From making transactions on the testnet to running simulations, testing, contributing to project code repositories. 

Anyone can participate in on-going bounties, with the potential to improve their ranking on the community leaderboard and earn CERE token rewards. 

To get started, all you have to do is join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/bFv6jkpK8N), introduce yourself in #general and let us know you're interested.
