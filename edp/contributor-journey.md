# Overview

As the Cere Network developer community matures, and individual and team contributors level up their skills, the challenges and responsiblities will increase in difficulty. But so will the rewards!

## Contributor Journey

### Level 1 - “Exploring”

- Simple tasks, which require no previous knowledge to participate in. 
  - For example, forking a repository or retweeting an important announcement.

### Level 2 - “Participating”

- Slightly more complicated tasks, which require familiarity with existing repositories and code, and a general overview of architecture and development workflows.
  - For example, submitting a bug report with steps to reproduce or sharing a unique, personalized review of a project or update in the ecosystem.

### Level 3 - “Contributing”

- We expect high-quality work at this level. Something which might be incorporated directly into the project or ecosystem.
  - For example, preparing a new example use-case not already covered in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.cere.network/ddc/developer-guide/examples/) or a complete bug/feature request including pull-request.

### Level 4 - “Leading”

- At this level, the community is gathering around you and looking for your advice and support directly. You're a role model and already contributing to the projects. 
  - For example, you're leading a workshop around implementing or integrating with Cere Network open source projects, leading a hackathon team or maintaining a community SDK project.
