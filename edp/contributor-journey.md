# Overview

As the Cere Network developer community matures, and individual and team contributors level up their skills, bounty difficulty and number of responsiblities will increase, along with the rewards!

The path developers will follow can be laid out as a simple Contributor's Journey. 

## Contributor Journey

### Level 1 - “Exploring”

Simple tasks, which require no previous knowledge to participate in. 

*You should learn what and why we're building Cere Network.*

- For example, forking a repository or retweeting an important announcement.

### Level 2 - “Participating”

Slightly more complicated tasks, which require familiarity with existing repositories and code, and a general overview of architecture and development workflows. 

*You should learn how to build on Cere Network.*

- For example, submitting a bug report with steps to reproduce or sharing a unique, personalized review of a project or update in the ecosystem.

### Level 3 - “Contributing”

We expect high-quality work at this level. Something which might be incorporated directly into the project or ecosystem. 

*You should be proficient builder within the Cere Ecosystem and seen as a essential part of the team.* 

- For example, preparing a new example use-case not already covered in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.cere.network/ddc/developer-guide/examples/) or a complete bug/feature request including pull-request.

### Level 4 - “Leading”

At this level, the community is gathering around you and looking for your advice and support directly. 

*You should be a role model and known within the community for your work. The community looks up to you for guidence and direction.*

- For example, you're leading a workshop around implementing or integrating with Cere Network open source projects, leading a hackathon team or maintaining a community SDK project, identifying critical gaps in usability, reliability or security and proactively working to close them.
