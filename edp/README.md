## What is the EDP Extended Developers Program?

Extended Developers Program aims to enable, engage and exponentially expand the open source developer communities integrating, innovating, and securing first and third-party decentralized Cere Network technologies with the legacy web2 and broader web3 blockchain ecosystems.

## Benefits of EDP

The Extended Developers Program is a Cere backed program offering early joining, tech-savvy individuals, teams and enterprises close and early access to critical changes in the ecosystem. 

We learn and work in Cere Network ecosystem, incentived to earn for good work building and integrating with Cere Network protocol and DDCv2.  We are exploring the edge of what' known in the decentralized storage space, gathering real-world use cases.

Elite contributors become community node operators, community admins and MODs, github project comitters, and sometimes Cere Network colleagues! Check [our latest listing!](https://jobs.lever.co/cere-network)

The Cere Network team engages with developers at events, and collaborating within the community and ecosystem at large on large scale projects and initiatives. 

Stay tuned! More on building, events, new grants programs and more. Soon. 

## Github

EDP contributes to the following Cere organizations:
- https://github.com/cere-io
- https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network

## OGs

We call the leaders of our community OG, like `old-gansgsta`. You'll see them around, and know it when you do. They come from the top of the ranks within the community. We couldn't work without them. They get paid for their work.

In the future, OGs will also be a major source of any DAOs Cere EDP community might get involved with.

## Campaigns

As Cere Network and Cere IO continue to make new releases, Cere EDP community will continue to explore new territories. 

New updates and major changes will be communicated through EDP campaigns. Incentivized campaign's might include ðŸ§µ's and youtube video bounties or various technical bounties that help us secure Cere Network, improve or add features, and solve real-world problems.

## Bounties

EDP offers bounties of various types and sizes. From making transactions on the testnet to running simulations, testing, contributing to project code repositories. 

The best will have additional opportunities to move up the leaderboard, unlocking new potential along the journey. Including project grants and sponsorships, CERE token rewards, event participation packages and more. 

We want to buidl!
