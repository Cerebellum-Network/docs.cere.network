# Overview of EDP
The Extended Developers Program is a Cere backed program offering early joining, tech-savvy individuals, teams and enterprises close and early access to critical changes in the ecosystem. 


## Benefits of EDP
Extended Developers Program aims to enable, engage and exponentially expand the open source developer communities integrating, innovating, and securing first and third-party decentralized Cere Network technologies with the legacy web2 and broader web3 blockchain ecosystems.

We learn and work in Cere Network ecosystem, incentived to earn for good work building and integrating with Cere Network protocol and DDCv2.  We are exploring the edge of what' known in the decentralized storage space, gathering real-world use cases.

Elite contributors become community node operators, community admins and MODs, github project comitters, and sometimes Cere Network colleagues! Check [our latest jobs!](https://jobs.lever.co/cere-network)

The Cere Network team engages with developers at events, and collaborating within the community and ecosystem at large on large scale projects and initiatives. 

Stay tuned! More on building, events, new grants programs and more. Soon.

## OGs
We call the leaders of our community OG, like `old-gansgsta`. You'll see them around, and know it when you do. They come from the top of the ranks within the community. 

They are responsible for helping at all levels of the community. We couldn't work without them, and they get paid for their work.

In the future, OGs will also be a major source of any DAOs Cere EDP community might initiate around the EDP program.

## Bounties
As Cere Network and Cere IO continue to make new releases, Cere EDP community will continue to explore new territories. 

One way EDP we will drive community engagement is through Bounty campaigns. These campaigns will offer many opportunities to learn, share and contribute to the Cere Network ecosystem. Some examples of incentivized bounties might include the posting of ðŸ§µ's and youtube video bounties or various technical bounties that help us secure Cere Network, improve or add features, and solve real-world problems.

The best will have additional opportunities to move up the leaderboard, unlocking new potential along the journey. Including project grants and sponsorships, CERE token rewards, event participation packages and more. 

More details about bounties in the [Bounty Hunt](bounties.md) section.
