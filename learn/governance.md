# Governance

The system by which entities are directed and controlled. It is concerned with structure and processes for decision making, accountability, control, and behaviour at the top of an entity.


### Mechanism

The public and Council can make changes to the network via referenda where all CERE holders, weighted by stake, can vote to make the decision at hand.


### Referenda

Referenda are simple, inclusive, stake-based voting schemes. For instance, upgrading the number of validators from 600 to 700. They are discrete events with fixed voting periods and they are binary, meaning the only options for voting are "aye" or "nay" (other than abstaining entirely).

### Type

There are several types of proposals:

* Publicly submitted proposals;
* Proposals submitted by the Council, either through a majority or unanimously;
* Proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum;
* Emergency proposals submitted by the Technical Committee and approved by the Council.

Enactment time — 28 days.

Note: For emergency proposals, the enactment period will be shorter.


### Proposing a Referendum

#### Public Referenda

Who: Anyone can propose

How: Depositing the minimum amount of tokens for a certain period (number of blocks).

What happens next:

1. If someone agrees with the proposal, they may deposit the same amount of tokens to support it. This action is called seconding.
2. The referendum with the highest number of tokens bonding will be selected for next voting cycle.
3. Only the number of tokens will be considered for moving to voting irrespective of the number of accounts that contributed.

Maximum of 100 public proposals in the proposal queue.

#### Council Referenda

Unanimous Council: All members of the council agree on a proposal

Majority Council: Agreement from a simple majority of council members. 

#### Voting Timetable

There are 2 Queues:
* Public referenda
* Council referenda

The referendum to be voted upon alternates between the top proposal in each of the two queues. There can only be one active referendum at any given time, except when there is also an emergency referendum in progress.

The "top" proposal is determined by the amount of staked tokens bonded behind it.

#### Voting on a Referendum

To vote, a voter generally must lock their tokens up for at least the enactment delay period (28 days) beyond the end of the referendum.

It is possible to vote without locking at all, but your vote is worth a small fraction of a normal vote given your stake.

#### Tallying

Approve - the number of aye votes against - the number of nay votes turnout - the total number of voting tokens (does not include conviction) electorate - the total number of CERE tokens issued in the network

#### Super-Majority Approve

#### &#x20;How to submit a proposal for the Network?

In order to submit a proposal:

1. Go to the [Cere Explorer](https://explorer.cere.network/#/democracy): Governance -> Democracy
2. Click on Submit Pre-image and fill in the form. Let’s say you want to propose to increase the amount of validators:

1. Copy preimage hash to the Clipboard
2. Click “Submit preimage”, then “Sign and Submit”
3. Click “Submit proposal”
4. Specify “preimage hash” and “locked balance”:

1. Click “Submit proposal” button then “Sign and Submit”

Now you should be able to see it in the “proposals” section:

#### How to vote for the proposal?

Wait until the end of each launch period. For example, for the current proposal you will need to wait about 22 days:

After this, the most seconded proposal will move to a referendum and voting will begin.

#### How does the proposal get applied?

Once all participants have voted the change will be applied if a majority of votes are in favor of the change.
