# Council

### Council

Cere Network's Council serves as an elected body of network participants that are intended to represent the passive stakeholders of the greater Cere Network. The Council serves two primary tasks in the Cere Network governance process: proposing referenda and vetoing malicious or dangerous referenda.

### Submitting Candidacy

In order to join the Cere Network Council, the submission request requires a small amount of Cere Tokens to be bonded. The bond will be forfeited if the candidacy submission does not win or becomes a runner-up. If you are elected to the Council, the bond will be kept.

If you intend to run for a spot on the Council it's a good idea to announce your intentions in one or more of Cere's public forums (Telegram, Twitter, etc.) prior to your submission so that your supporters will know when to vote for you.

### Submission

Navigate to the Cere Network Council tab [here](https://explorer.cere.network/#/council). Click on the "Submit candidacy" button.
