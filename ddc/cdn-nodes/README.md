# ‚òÅ CDN Nodes

CDN node is stateless node which responsible for routing content to storage nodes, replication, caching(**not implemented yet**). All access to stored data goes through the CDN node.

A CDN node is also a web gateway to DDC. It can act as a web server and provide content to
regural HTTP clients, especially web browsers. Web apps can rely on CDN nodes to serve various assets,
or even be hosted completely on DDC.
