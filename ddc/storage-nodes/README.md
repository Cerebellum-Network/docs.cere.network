# üåê Storage Service

The DDC offers clusters with storage services which persists data safely and allows searching and retrieving data.
A core component of the storage service is the DDC storage node, which is responsible for partitions of the data. Safety and scalability is achieved by spreading the data over a number of nodes.

## Recovery

Every  DDC storage has Merkle DAG which presents a tree of stored files. When a node is inconsistent, the storage node can recover data by using its own Merkle DAG and replica nodes for searching required files and copying.

## Metrics

The storage node provides metrics for monitoring:

* General HTTP metrics
* Stored data in bytes
* Stored piece number
