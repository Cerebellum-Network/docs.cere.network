## What is the DDC Network?

DDC is a Decentralised Data Cloud offering services to store, retrieve, accelerate and manage data to enable real world use cases.

## Benefits of DDC

DDC enables you to built real-world use cases on a Decentralized Data cloud where the User owns the data. It provides multiple services on the protocol level and a toolset to quickly get started building dApps and serverless applications. DDC offers flexible data management, secure, reliable and GDPR compliant data storing, fast data delivery, Built-in File Sharing and serverless App hosting. 

## Network participants

Users are developers who want to store and retrieve data.

Providers want to make money. They provide hardware.

Users do not trust providers to provide correctly and to keep their data safe. Providers do not trust users to pay them.
That is why users and providers meet around a "cluster". A cluster is chosen by users and providers; this is an easier choice than all users and providers connecting directly.
Users and providers can come and go in and out of a cluster and be replaced by others.
A cluster is managed by a set of rules and by a number of cluster validators.

## Services

There are multiple services in DDC.

Blockchain for payments and management.

Explain that there are users and providers, services and payments, all forming a market.

TODO

Write up the [contract concepts](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/ddc-bucket-contract/blob/dev/DOC.md), very simplified.

User ownership is abstracted by buckets.

The contract between users and providers is organized by clusters.

Explain the ownership of data (self-custody apps or managed apps).
