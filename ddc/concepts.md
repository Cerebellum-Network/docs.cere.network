# ðŸ“– Concepts

Before starting, we should introduce the problem that we are solving, provide and overview of our innovation and present our business model. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO

Explain that there are users and providers, services and payments, all forming a market.
{% endhint %}

What is the basic use case? Put the User in context. Then, define:
- User 
- Storage nodes
- Providers
- Clusters
- Managers. Explain to what extent this feature requires human input. If there is human input, what is financial incentive to do so. How does a manager organize nodes into a cluster?
- Payments.
- Smart contract basics
- How all these elements come together by smart contract.

For each definition, conclude with the option to go deeper e.g., "To understand more about how this feature works, see [this](https://www.google.com/) part of the code."

TODO

Write up the [contract concepts](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/ddc-bucket-contract/blob/dev/DOC.md), very simplified.

User ownership is abstracted by buckets.

The contract between users and providers is organized by clusters.

Explain the ownership of data (self-custody apps or managed apps).
