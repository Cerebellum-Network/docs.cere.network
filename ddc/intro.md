# Storage Node

DDC Storage Node is a core component of DDC that is responsible for storing and retrieving the data. Itâ€™s written in Go and consists of a large set of components and modules, which are shown in the high level architecture diagram below.

DDC nodes operations are coordinated and rewarded through smart contracts running on the Cere test/main blockchains.

This section covers the configuration of DDC Smart Contracts and DDC Inspector nodes.
