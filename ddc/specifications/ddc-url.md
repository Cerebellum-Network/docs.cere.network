![Structure of DDC URLs](<../../.gitbook/assets/DDC URL.png>)


## URI - Queries in the DDC Protocol

A URI represents an object or a set of objects in the DDC network.


### File protocol

A `ddc:file` URI represents a file. The basic query points to a file path inside of a named bucket:

    ddc:file/BUCKET_NAME/FILE_PATH

or by bucket ID:

    ddc:file/BUCKET_ID/FILE_PATH

FILE_PATH resolves to a query of pieces by tag in DDC Object Storage. The piece will be interpreted
as a file descriptor, possibly fetching the file content from other pieces.

BUCKET_NAME or BUCKET_ID resolves to a query in the DDC bucket system to identify the current set
of storage nodes where the file pieces should be found.


### Piece protocol

A `ddc:piece` URI represents a piece or a list of pieces in DDC Object Storage.

Search a piece by tag and bucket name:

    ddc:piece/BUCKET_NAME/?tag=KEY:VALUE

Or by bucket ID:

    ddc:piece/BUCKET_ID/?tag=KEY:VALUE

Represent a piece by Content ID and bucket ID:

    ddc:piece/BUCKET_ID/CID

Represent a piece by Content ID, without a hint for a containing bucket:

    ddc:piece/*/CID

Select a piece with additional options:

    ddc:piece/BUCKET_NAME/?tag=KEY:VALUE&version:latest


## URL - The gateway from the web to DDC

DDC defines URLs that can be used anywhere where HTTPS is expected, i.e. in web browsers. A web URL is constructed with the URL to a CDN node, followed by the DDC URI to resolve, like so:

    CDN_NODE_URL/DDC_URI

For example:

    https://cdn.cere.network/ddc:file/my_bucket/image.png
    ^                        ^
    The web gateway          The DDC URI

The URL identifies a file, and suggest a CDN node that can retrieve it from the DDC network. Given
a request for this URL, the CDN node will find the data piece(s) that describe the file, and return
the file content.

The client may also use another CDN node of his choice, or it may use the `ddc:file` protocol by itself and
find the file in storage nodes directly.

The URI of an object can always be parsed from a URL by detecting the first occurence of the string `/ddc:`
