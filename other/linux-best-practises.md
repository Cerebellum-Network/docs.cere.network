# Linux Best Practises

* Never use the root user.
* Always update the security patches for your OS.
* Enable and set up a firewall.
* Never allow password-based SSH, only use key-based access.
* Disable non-essential SSH subsystems (banner, motd, scp, X11 forwarding) and harden your SSH configuration.
* Back up your storage regularly.
