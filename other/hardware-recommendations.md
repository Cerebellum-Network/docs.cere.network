# Hardware Recommendations

* **CPU** - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz
* **Storage** - A NVMe solid state drive. Should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth. Starting around 80GB - 160GB will be okay, but will need to be re-evaluated every six months.
* **Memory** - 2GB - 8GB. 2GB is really the minimum memory you should operate your validator with, anything less than this makes build times too inconvenient. For better performance you can bump it up to 4GB or 8GB, but anything more than that is probably overkill. In order to compile the binary yourself you will likely need \~8GB.
