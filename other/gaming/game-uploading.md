### Prepare the archive

1. Build the game in case you use a bundler like **Webpack**
2.  Archive the produced static assets
    1. The archive should be a `ZIP` file. Example:

       [Game archive example](https://assets.cms.freeport.cere.network/tower_game_ab695df561.zip)

    2. The archive should include a folder with all the gameâ€™s assets:

        ```
        [game_name].zip/
        â””â”€â”€ [game_name]/
            â”œâ”€â”€ ...(game assets)
            â””â”€â”€ index.html
        ```

        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ Make sure that you removed OS specific system files from the archive, eg. `.DS_Store` in case of **macOS**.
