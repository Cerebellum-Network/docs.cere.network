# Leaderboard and rules displaying

After the player has played the game, he gets to the window with the leaderboard.

The top of the modal window displays the name of your custom event and the number of days until it ends.

## Rules displaying

The rules for displaying the leaderboard are as follows:

- If there is an active tournament, then we show information about it and the leaderboard corresponding to this tournament.
- If there is no active tournament, then we show the default text and a leaderboard that includes all the results of the players, excluding the results that were earned in tournaments
